# Lunora Player Deployment Lessons Learned

## Node.js 22.x Migration & Production Deployment Attempts - June 7, 2025

**Summary**: This document captures key lessons learned during the Node.js 22.x migration and production deployment attempts. These insights will help avoid similar issues in future deployments.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED

### Issue #1: Node.js Migration Deployment Loop
- **Problem**: Got stuck in deployment loop when migrating from Node.js 18.x to 22.x
- **Root Cause**: Complex path handling logic incompatible with Lambda Function URLs + missing permissions
- **Solution**: Complete Lambda function deletion/recreation + restored working code from dist/lambda-function.js
- **Key Lesson**: **Always keep working backups of deployed code**. The `dist/lambda-function.js` file saved the entire deployment.

### Issue #2: Lambda Function URL Permissions
- **Problem**: Function URL returning 403 Forbidden errors
- **Root Cause**: Missing `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` permission in resource-based policy
- **Solution**: Added proper resource-based policy for Function URL access
- **Key Lesson**: **Lambda Function URLs require explicit permissions** - they don't inherit from execution role

### Issue #3: Production vs Development Environment Confusion
- **Problem**: Working on localhost while production deployment was broken
- **Root Cause**: Lost track of which environment was being tested
- **Solution**: Clear separation of local vs production configurations
- **Key Lesson**: **Always verify which environment you're working in** - use environment-specific API URLs

### Issue #4: API URL Configuration Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Production S3 files had wrong/placeholder API URLs
- **Root Cause**: Production deployment not updated with correct Lambda URL after recreation
- **Solution**: Systematic update of all production files with correct URLs
- **Key Lesson**: **Production deployments must be updated as a complete unit** when infrastructure changes

---

## üü° DEPLOYMENT BEST PRACTICES LEARNED

### 1. Infrastructure Management
- **Complete cleanup approach**: Sometimes delete/recreate is more effective than incremental fixes
- **Preserve working versions**: Always backup working deployments before major changes
- **Function URL vs API Gateway**: Different event structures and permission models

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Environment-specific configs**: Separate local and production API URLs clearly
- **Systematic updates**: When infrastructure changes, update ALL dependent files
- **Validation**: Test configuration changes in isolation before full deployment

### 3. Debugging Approach
- **Start with health checks**: Always verify basic connectivity first
- **Check permissions**: AWS permissions are often the root cause of 403/500 errors
- **Incremental testing**: Test each component individually before integration

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS THAT WORKED

### Lambda Function Recreation Process
```bash
# 1. Delete problematic function completely
aws lambda delete-function --function-name FUNCTION_NAME

# 2. Recreate with correct runtime
aws lambda create-function --runtime nodejs22.x

# 3. Deploy working code from backup
aws lambda update-function-code --zip-file fileb://working-backup.zip

# 4. Add Function URL permissions
aws lambda add-permission --action lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl
```

### Production File Update Process
```bash
# 1. Update local files with correct API URLs
# 2. Create production build
# 3. Deploy to S3 buckets systematically
# 4. Verify each component individually
```

## üìã PREVENTION CHECKLIST FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS

### Before Starting Deployment
- [ ] Create complete backup of current working state
- [ ] Document current production URLs and configurations
- [ ] Test all changes in development environment first
- [ ] Verify AWS credentials and permissions

### During Deployment
- [ ] Deploy infrastructure changes first
- [ ] Update configuration files with new URLs
- [ ] Test each component individually
- [ ] Verify API connectivity before frontend deployment

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test complete end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Document new production URLs
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create rollback plan for next deployment

## üö® **CRITICAL: SYSTEMATIC DEPLOYMENT PROCESS TO PREVENT RECURRING ISSUES**

### **PROBLEM ANALYSIS (June 14, 2025)**
**Recurring Issues:**
1. ‚ùå Multiple conflicting `index.js` files in different directories
2. ‚ùå CORS issues reappearing after rollbacks
3. ‚ùå Missing dependencies in every deployment
4. ‚ùå Duplicate deployment directories causing confusion

### **ROOT CAUSES:**
1. **No single source of truth** for deployment files
2. **Manual deployment process** prone to human error
3. **CORS configured in multiple places** (Function URL + code)
4. **No systematic dependency analysis**

---

## üîß **SYSTEMATIC DEPLOYMENT DEPENDENCY CHECKLIST**

### **CRITICAL: Always Analyze ALL require() Statements Before Deployment**

**Problem**: Repeatedly missing local file dependencies in Lambda deployments
**Root Cause**: Not systematically checking all `require()` statements in main file
**Solution**: Use this checklist for EVERY deployment

#### **Pre-Deployment Dependency Analysis:**
```bash
# 1. Find ALL require statements in main handler file
grep -n "require(" lambda-handler.js

# 2. Identify local vs npm dependencies
# Local files: require('./filename') or require('../path')
# NPM packages: require('package-name')

# 3. For each local file dependency, recursively check ITS dependencies
grep -n "require(" dependency-file.js

# 4. Copy ALL local dependencies to deployment directory
cp dependency1.js deployment-dir/
cp dependency2.js deployment-dir/
# etc.

# 5. Verify all files present before zipping
ls -la deployment-dir/
```

#### **Deployment Package Contents Verification:**
- [ ] Main handler file (index.js)
- [ ] package.json with correct dependencies
- [ ] node_modules/ with all npm packages
- [ ] ALL local file dependencies identified via require() analysis
- [ ] ALL transitive local dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)

#### **Example from June 14, 2025 Fix:**
**Main file**: `lambda-handler.js` required:
- ‚úÖ `aws-sdk` (npm - included)
- ‚ùå `./multi-channel-manager-robust` (local - MISSING)
- ‚ùå `./schema-migration` (local - MISSING)

**Transitive dependency**: `schema-migration.js` required:
- ‚ùå `./default-presets` (local - MISSING)

**Result**: 3 missing files caused 502 Bad Gateway errors

---

## üîó **API ENDPOINT CONSISTENCY ISSUES (June 13, 2025)**

### **PROBLEM**: Frontend calling incorrect API endpoints causing 404 errors
- Health endpoint was calling `/health` instead of `/api/health`
- Streaming status was calling `/api/destinations/status` instead of `/api/streaming/status`

### **ROOT CAUSE**: Inconsistent endpoint usage between frontend and backend
- Backend correctly implements `/api/health` and `/api/streaming/status`
- Frontend had hardcoded wrong endpoints

### **SOLUTION**:
- Fixed health endpoint: Use `${this.apiBaseUrl}/health` ‚Üí `/api/health`
- Fixed streaming status: Use `${this.apiBaseUrl}/streaming/status` ‚Üí `/api/streaming/status`
- Deploy frontend and invalidate CloudFront cache

### **PREVENTION**:
- Always verify API endpoints match between frontend and backend
- Use consistent `apiBaseUrl` variable instead of hardcoded URLs
- Test API calls in browser developer tools during development
- Document all API endpoints in a single source of truth

## üéØ **SCRIPTS ORGANIZATION & DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW (June 13, 2025)**

### **PROBLEM**: Scattered deployment scripts and unclear deployment process
- Backend deployment script in `backend/deploy.sh`
- Verification scripts in project root
- No clear naming convention or organization
- No complete deployment pipeline

### **SOLUTION**: Professional scripts organization
```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-all.sh                    # Complete deployment pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-backend.sh                # Backend Lambda deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-frontend.sh               # Frontend S3/CloudFront deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ verify-backend-deployment.sh     # Backend verification (100% file matching)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ verify-frontend-deployment.sh    # Frontend verification (100% file matching)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                        # Complete scripts documentation
```

### **BENEFITS**:
- ‚úÖ **Clear naming convention**: `deploy-*` and `verify-*` prefixes
- ‚úÖ **Complete pipeline**: Single command for full deployment
- ‚úÖ **Professional organization**: All deployment tools in one place
- ‚úÖ **Verification system**: 100% file matching for both frontend and backend
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation**: Scripts README explains everything

### **USAGE**:
```bash
# Complete deployment (recommended)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh

# Individual components
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh

# Verification only
./scripts/verify-backend-deployment.sh
./scripts/verify-frontend-deployment.sh
```

### **PREVENTION**:
- Always use organized scripts from `scripts/` folder
- Use `deploy-all.sh` for complete deployments
- Run verification scripts to confirm 100% synchronization
- Reference `scripts/README.md` for detailed usage instructions
